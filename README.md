## This questions are due next discussion section (Week6).

1. Describe the Biology of your project? (one paragraph max).  

My project deals with eDNA and data processing/data analysis of microbiome. Microbiome is a large community of microorgansims in a variety of environments. The PUMA project specifically deals with the strain 16S rRNA and how it creats a common barrier in microbiome studies. Microrganisms shed while they move throughout their environemtn, ans that eDNA is what is important for us to study and collect data for. 

2. Describe the kind of data that you think you will be handling (one paragraph max). 

I will be working with Meta and OTU data. The Metadata includes soil temperature, numerous element contents, date of collection, location, plant common and scientific name and many more. The OTU data simple contains sum taxonomy along with lots of eDNA data.


3. What would you like to do with that data? (one paragraph max).  

I would like to take the three Metadata tables and concatenate them so that there is one single header with no repeating headers throuout the merged final table. For OTU I would like to do the same effect where there is one common header with all the data listed below with 17 then 18 then 19 following. The table should flow fluidly.

4. What will be the output? (one paragraph max).  

The output will be two concantentated tables with all Metadata in one and all OTU data in the other respectively. There will be filler where data has not been taken for some of the tables. The most important part of the output is to have a fluid header that represents all 3 of the Metadata tables and all three of the OTU tables.

5. Is there any computational tool, package, etc. you would like to use? What would you do with that? For instance, you could mention shell scripts with `sed` or `awk` and will change the format of a table by replacing `,` with tabs. 
Also, you could mention tools that we haven’t seen in class yet but you herd that may be useful for your project. 
For instance, you could say 
***I will use the package “GenomeGraphs” implement in the R software to visualize genome data***. (a few sentences max).

You will only need python and a tect editor like text wrangler to see individual characters

6. What is your biggest concern regarding your project? (a few sentences max).

My biggest concern will be to actually get teh program running and working.
